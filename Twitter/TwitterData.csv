cahaseler,@adamdavidlong @HamelHusain @LangChainAI @quarto_pub Two options: 1. use gpt3.5 and openai's fine tuning service. Probably not ideal and not cheap. 2. Use langchain and parse the docs to a vectorstore. Let the bot search it as needed with an agent. ChatGPT api is 10x cheaper and smarter. Still ironing out issues though.,0,0,Twitter for Android,,
