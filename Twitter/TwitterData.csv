itsandrewgao,"AFAIK #GPT3 can not understand length. i.e. if you tell it to ""write a long essay"" it won't, even if you have tokens left.

e.g., if your prompt is ""write a very long essay on trees"", there's no way to get GPT3 to use up all the remaining tokens. it usually stop after 500 words.",27,2,Typefully,2023-03-05 18:18:01,-1

cahaseler,@adamdavidlong @HamelHusain @LangChainAI @quarto_pub Two options: 1. use gpt3.5 and openai's fine tuning service. Probably not ideal and not cheap. 2. Use langchain and parse the docs to a vectorstore. Let the bot search it as needed with an agent. ChatGPT api is 10x cheaper and smarter.
