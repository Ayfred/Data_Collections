I learned a lot and at a faster rate than usual since I started doing that.  \\nFor me it feels now like a tool that allows me to build what I imagine. The whole development process has been sped up noticeably. \\n\\nI hope I can use it to build a procedural animation system for movement, fighting and such.

Animals are smart enough to use tools and if they were as smart enough as us or be the dominant species, they would just do what we do and more but that being said, so far everything had a pinch of humanity behind it. Someone who has made a factory and automated his work, shows how smart or lazy that person is. Someone online that you text with could be at most a catfish and a pretender but still a human behind that interface. Every piece of art that has been made is either motivated by creative vision, experiences or heck even statistics filled with corporate greed but what really shook me is that though it may be far, we are reaching a point where almost no human interaction would even be needed to satisfy your needs, wants or getting things done. We listen to music and consume arts by discovering them, we like certain artists, we dislike others but if we are in an era where we wont be bothered by it even. We just wish for whatever experience, song, art etc we desire and we just experience it through a library of everything that exists. Your favorite song being the one that no human wrote for example. It feels like anyone beyond a certain point who did something creative and groundbreaking would only be trivial in the future if we even consider it important and share the same sentiments we do today.
